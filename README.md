It is a pressing task to develop effective methods to manage and retrieve these multimedia resources by their content. Text, which carries high-level semantic information, is a kind of important object that is useful for this task.
We have developed this software, by formulating & assessing the needs of the client to enhance their usability, productiveness, speed, ease of access, time and money saving, data storage.
Text data present in images and video contain useful information for automatic annotation, indexing, and structuring of images. Extraction of this information involves detection, localization, tracking, extraction, enhancement, and recognition of the text from a given image. However, variations of text due to differences in size, style, orientation, and alignment, as well as low image contrast and complex background make the problem of automatic text extraction extremely challenging. While comprehensive surveys of related problems such as face detection, document analysis, and image & video indexing can be found, the problem of text information extraction is not well surveyed. A large number of techniques have been proposed to address this problem, and the purpose of this paper is to classify and review these algorithms, discuss benchmark data and performance evaluation, and to point out promising directions for future research.

     Introduction
Today the most information is available either on paper or in the form of photographs or videos. Large information is stored in images. The current technology is restricted to extracting text against clean backgrounds. Thus, there is a need for a system to extract text from general backgrounds. There are various applications in which text extraction is useful. These applications include digital libraries, multimedia systems, Information retrieval systems, and Geographical Information systems. The role of text detection is to find the image regions containing only text that can be directly highlighted to the user or fed into an optical character reader module for recognition. In this paper a new system is proposed which extracts text in images. The system takes colored images as input. It detects text on the basis of certain text features: text possesses certain frequency and orientation information; text shows spatial cohesion—characters of the same text string (a word, or words in the same line) are of similar heights, orientation, and spacing. The image is then cleaned up so that the text stands out.

     Problem Statement
Extracting text from images or videos is an important problem in many applications like document processing, image indexing, video content summary, video retrieval, video understanding. In natural scene images and videos, text characters and strings usually appear in nearby sign boards and hand-held objects and provide significant knowledge of surrounding environment and objects. Natural scene images usually suffer from low resolution and low quality, perspective distortion and complex background. Scene text is hard to detect, extract and recognize since it can appear with any slant, tilt, in any lighting, upon any surface and may be partially occluded.
